# Drum&Bass Hideout

Drum&Bass Hideout is a website that strives to give people who are passionate about the UK Drum and Bass scene a chance to experience the best artists by reading into their background and listening to some of their top tracks through our interactive Spotify plugin.
Drum&Bass Hideout also wants to give a chance to the non-stop ravers to tune into our 24/7 radio to keep the party mood throughout the week. For those who are more of the weekend ravers we have our live sessions every Saturday.

## Features

There are several features on the website that help our targeted audience navigate through the pages to enable them to experience what Drum&Bass Hideout has to offer.

### Existing Features

- **Navigation Bar**

  - The navigation bar is fully responsive and featured on all three pages. It contains a logo, and links to the three pages that are offered - Home, Artist, Sign up.
  - For mobile users the navigation bar shrinks in size and features a burger icon that contains the links to the three pages that are offered.
  - The navigation bar will allow users to easily navigate across the three pages that we offer with support on all devices. This prevents the user from having to use the "back" button.
  - While scrolling through the page the user will notice that the navigation bar is sticky which allows them to have easy access to the rest of the pages offered.

- **The Footer**

  - The footer is featured on all three pages and is fully responsive.
  - The footer is segmented into three parts:
    - The first segment contains the logo and a slogan as well as information about who the author of the website is about and why it was created.
    - The second segment contains 4 icons, one which contains a link. The first three icons give information about the Location, Email and Phone Number of Drum&Bass Hideout. The last icon is a link to the Github repository of the author.
    - The third segment is a disclaimer that notifies the user of the owner ship of the media content used on the website.
  - The footer is valuable to the users because it gives them information about who the author of the page is and how to get in touch.

- **Artist Page**

  - The artist page contains 5 sections - Artist cards section and a section featuring the artists.

- **Artist cards section**

  - This section contains 4 tiles in the form of a card for each artist that is featured on the Drum&Bass Hideout website.
  - Each card contains an image of the specific artist, a heading with the name of the artist, a paragraph with a eye-catching introduction of the artist and a "Read More" button which directs the user to the specific section on the page about the artist.
  - This brings value to the users to quickly identify which artist they want to explore more about without having to scroll further down the to find the specific artist section they are looking for.

- **Artist content section**

  - This section contains an image and social links of the respective artists. Each social link will redirect the user to the artists social media page in a different tab.
  - There is also a heading containing the stage name of the artist and a paragraph with more detailed information about the artists origin and career.
  - The section also contains a "Biography" button that will redirect the user to a new page on a new tab where the user can read more in-depth information about the artist.
  - The user also has the ability to experience some of the top tracks of the respective artist through the interactive Spotify player.
  - As the user scrolls further down the page they can see that a similar section is followed, however the content is flipped. This design was chosen to make the page feel more interactive.
  - Each section of the artists gives value to the user to experience the artist both visually and audibly.

### Features Left to Implement

- Another feature I would have liked to implement would have been a merchandise shop to allow users to buy products of their beloved artists.

## Testing

The form of testing I have done to ensure that the webpage behaves correctly was mostly manual testing by using the Chrome Developer Tools. Each page while being developed was tested that it scales appropriately to different screen sizes to ensure that all the content that is used is fitting correctly.

In addition to that when I deployed the final changes on the website I performed Usability testing by asking friends and family if the content of the website is clear and if the page is easy to navigate.
All of the users came back with feedback that the page was clear and easy to use, however, users that were on iPhone devices noticed that the landing page hero image was not visible.

![iPhone Bug](https://github.com/Jordan-Boulton1/Drum-Bass-Hideout/blob/main/assets/documentation/dnb-hero-image-bug.jpg)

The bug was happening because of the CSS background shorthand property which resulted in not rendering the image correctly for iPhone devices. After applying the styling without the shorthand property the image was rendered correctly for iPhone devices.
